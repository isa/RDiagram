# RDiagram

Daily basis we need to create some diagrams. We used Dot from [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) for a long time, however the diagrams are not interactive and they are so ugly. Then we decided to create a little project which has better output and also interactivity.

## What's RDiagram

RDiagram is a diagram generator based on [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.org). It basically generates 5 different diagram types and outputs them in SVG. Every diagram type is an extension to our library. And they may/or not have different DSL (Domain Specific Language) for diagrams.

## Running Tests

First, make sure that you've installed jspec (gem install JSpec) and [Mozilla Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html) into your system.

## Summary

Hope you guys like it.
