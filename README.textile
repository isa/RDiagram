h1. RDiagram

Daily basis we need to create some diagrams. We used Dot from "Graphviz":http://www.graphviz.org for a long time, however the diagrams are not interactive and they are so ugly. Then we decided to create a little project which has better output and also interactivity.

h3. What's RDiagram

RDiagram is a diagram generator based on "RaphaelJS":http://raphaeljs.org. It basically generates 5 different diagram types and outputs them in SVG. Every diagram type is an extension to our library. And they may/or not have different DSL (Domain Specific Language) for diagrams.

h3. Running Tests

First, make sure that you've installed jspec (tests/jspec) and "Mozilla Rhino":http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html into your system.
